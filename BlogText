Nice! The menu items inside each ul now are now inline elements. [We'll see how to move the two uls to display on the same line in the next section.]

Next let's change the position of the text inside the large feature. Currently the text is positioned at the very top of the large feature. Let's move the text down so that its more in the middle of the large feature. This can be done with the position property.

In index.html, the <div class="jumbotron">..</div> groups elements that are part of the large feature section of the web page. Inside <div class="jumbotron">..</div> is the <div class="container">..</div> which has the text we want to style.
